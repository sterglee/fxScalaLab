# fxScalaLab

## A version of ScalaLab with a JavaFX interface ##


## Project Summary

`This project aims to provide a pure JavaFX interface to the ScalaLab project that is  based on the Swing framework. JavaFX is clearly better than Swing, offering much better  control over the overall Graphical User Interface (GUI) components, better support for configuration  and improved mulithreading. Also, is the official supported platform for the development of GUIs for the Java platfor. Therefore, the project aims to gradually implement all the original functionality of the Swing based ScalaLab project with JavaFX technology  only. `
